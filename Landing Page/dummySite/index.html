      <p>Perishable Application is a web-based program designed to connect food providers, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and anyone else who has food to give away that is still edible but not really sellable, to charities and shelters, which need large amounts of food. The application works by getting the food providers to list the expired items that they have available to be picked up, and allowing different charities and shelters to place reservations on the available items.</p>
      <p>This application is owned by United Way Regina. It was originally programed by Jeremy Tkachuk, Bennat Jose, and Md Meer. The banner at the top, the main logo for the application, and this write-up were all created by me, Bennett Eidsness.</p>
